To sum up the hard truth of the manifestable reality:
It does not matter if you're
An Agnostic or theist
An Idealist or skeptics
Or a dreamer with hope of a grand betterment

All are but faith
Ideals, if you'd like it
And one of these days, things might not pass through
And you'll find yourself torn apart
By the very weight of the hope
That silently forces you to believe
In the righteousness, the warmth of knowing
that what you believe in
Can somehow save your souls

Yet, it's not so much self-pity
That will throw you out of
The pit of despair
It takes courage, yes
Sometimes denial,
but most importantly
Acceptance
Since the world goes on anyway
And what are we but
A speck of dust in the galaxy,
Drifting away in the
grand scheme of things

And while I have it in me
Words to capture the moment
A faint voice cries within
"You shall put it here"
before they come
To naught
