There are times when you crawl
and moments where you fall
the joy of what's fleeting
yet to feel pain and suffering
to be pushed to the brink
seems so everlasting

Then you make your stand
in a no man's land
you pout and you wallow
in your pitty as you swallow
the bitter pill and you grow
bitter, but not better
bigger, but not kinder

Then the hours grow
and the darkness haunts
the pain and suffering gnaws
and you curse, and you curse


Yet still the hours grow
and the shade lingers
as the sun drowns
the darkness dawns

but the world still spin
and everything falls into place
the moon, smiles 
the stars, shines
out of the life that glows
even when hatred takes hold
even with all the pain and suffering
even when it is pushed to the brink

For it is in despair, there is hope
in sadness, the blessing of joy
in death, the beauty of a fleeting life
and in enduring, 
forgiveness


and that moment you realise
that this is but a fool's paradise
